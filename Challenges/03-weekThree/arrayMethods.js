/*
Arrays

    - Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.
        -There are array methods that allow us to traverse, as well as mutate, the data being held by an array. 
        
        - Arrays are 0 indexed, meaning the first item in an array will have an index of 0 and the last item will have an index of the arrays lenght minus 1.
